# Frontend - NashTech SurveyHub

## Angular Frontend

This directory contains the Angular application for the Survey Platform.

### Current State
This is the existing Open Data Assessment Angular application, which will be:
1. Refactored to work with the new Spring Boot backend
2. Enhanced with dynamic survey rendering capabilities
3. Expanded to include Admin Dashboard and Survey Builder UI

### Running Locally
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200`

**Note:** Currently configured for Firebase. Will be updated to use Spring Boot APIs in future feature branches.
