# NashTech Open Data Maturity Assessment

This is a practical implementation of the Open Data Institute (ODI) maturity framework. It provides a guided questionnaire, a modern Angular user interface, and an export feature that generates Excel reports.

The goal is to help teams and organisations assess their open data practices, capture results, and produce clear, shareable reports.

## ODI Framework Coverage

This assessment follows the ODI maturity model and includes 47 questions organised by theme:

- Data Publication Process (8 questions)
- Data Literacy and Skills (6 questions)
- Customer Support and Engagement (9 questions)
- Investment and Financial Performance (6 questions)
- Strategic Oversight (8 questions)

Responses are scored using the official five-level maturity scale:

1. Initial — Ad-hoc processes with limited structure
2. Repeatable — Some processes exist but are inconsistent
3. Defined — Documented processes and standards
4. Managed — Processes are monitored and managed
5. Optimising — Continuous improvement and innovation


## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or later
- Angular CLI 17 or later
- A modern web browser with JavaScript enabled

### Install and run locally

```bash
npm install
ng serve

# Then open http://localhost:4200 in your browser
```

### Build for production

```bash
ng build --configuration production
```

## Configuration

### Google Gemini API Key
To enable the AI-powered recommendations, you need a Google Gemini API key.

1.  Get a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  Open `src/app/environments/environment.ts`.
3.  Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual key:
    ```typescript
    export const environment = {
      // ...
      geminiApiKey: 'AIzaSy...'
    };
    ```


## Features

- Guided questionnaire following the ODI model
- Progress tracking and auto-save of answers
- Results dashboard with overall and theme-based scores
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Personalized, actionable advice generated by Google Gemini AI based on your specific answers.
- **PDF Report Export**: Download a comprehensive PDF report including user details, scores, and a full list of questions and answers.
- Excel export with Summary, Detailed Responses, and Theme Analysis sheets
- Offline storage for in-progress assessments

## Excel Export Details

The exported Excel file includes at least three sheets:

- Summary: participant details, overall score, maturity level, and recommendations
- Detailed Responses: question-level answers, individual scores (1–5), and theme labels
- Theme Analysis: aggregated statistics, average scores, and maturity levels by theme

The export applies simple formatting, automated file naming, and basic validation to aid sharing and reporting.

## Technical Overview

- Angular (standalone components) and TypeScript
- Reactive Forms for handling user input and validation
- RxJS for reactive state handling
- Angular Material components with custom theming
- SCSS for styling

Performance considerations include route-based lazy loading and OnPush change detection where appropriate.
